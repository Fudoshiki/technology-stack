## tl;dr

One of the most "_difficult decisions_" you will make in your "_carreer_" is 
which technologies and tools you will use to get your work done. 

Most people have the decision made _for_ them by the company/organisation
they work for (_e.g: Java -> Spring, Ruby -> Rails or  PHP -> WordPress or Symphony, etc._)
This is because most companies _already_ have an _existing_ application in "production",
which you have been hired to extend.

Occasionally you will get the chance to build an app from "_scratch_"  
however _most_ of the time someone _else_ (_the "Architect"_) will make the decision for what "_stack_"
to use on you behalf, so you will _still_ be stuck someone _else's_ choices.
If you are _incredibly lucky_ the "Architect(s)" will have done their homework survey the latest industry
trends and investigated the "_promising_" technologies
e.g: Stack Overflow  "Most Wanted" list.
However _most_ of the time the Architect will go with one of these 3 options:

1.  Go with what you know, use _existing_ stack with a minor vairation because it's "easy to deploy" with the existing infrastructure
and will not get questioned by the DevOps team or "Compliance" department.

2.  Buy the whizz-bang all-in-one solution sold to them by the "Consultant" from "Big Vendor" 
(_outsource the thinking to a sales person who last wrote code in the 90's ... seems like a great idea!_)

3. Be "Bold" and try "Popular Framework XYZ" and hire an external team to build the new magic app.
then attempt to 




Distillery for deployment.
