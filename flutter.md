# `Flutter`

**Creative technology** 
is **_constantly_ evolving**. <br />
There is always
a **`new` way** 
of ***solving*** an 
**old problem** <br />
and in some cases 
**_significantly_ simplifying** 
the solution.

<!--
_Some_ people prefer to stick to what they _already_ know 
and avoid learning new things and that's OK, 
after all there are still plenty of jobs writing [FORTRAN](

ü¶ñ
This works in the _short-term_ because
most _organisations_ take a long time to adopt new tech
so people can cling onto their ageing knowledge.

-->

# _Why_? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@dwyl we **_periodically_ ask ourselves** the **question**: <br />
If I was **starting** my journey **from _scratch_** now
**what tech** would I learn/use? <br />

If we could keep all 
the knowledge/wisdom and experience gained
over 20+ years of programming 
but avoid any preconceptions and biases 
i.e.
["sunk cost bias"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect).
Would we still choose the tech/tools we are _currently_ using?
Or would we pick something else completely different?


The people/teams/organisations that can _objectively_
question why they use particular tech/tools
can take advantage
of all the advancements being made
in the wider developer community.

# _What_? üì±

The question we need to ask/answer
_before_ diving into any discussion
of which technology/language/framework
we should or shouldn't use is:
**What are _problem_ are we _trying_ to _solve_?**


The last time we (_informally_) looked at `Flutter` in early 2018,
it did _not_ meet all our needs for a UI framework. 
At the time, it was focussed on Android,
didn't support Web/PWAs
and only had partial/beta support for IOs.

In the last couple of years `Flutter` has seen _rapid_
development both from the _army_ of **Google** Developers
and the thriving community and it has matured considerably.
It _excels_  at _all_ of our requirements.

Google is using `Flutter`
for several of their cross-platform Native Mobile Apps
including Google Adds (_their main money maker_)
and ***Stadia*** their recently launched gaming platform.
See: 
[flutter.dev/showcase](https://flutter.dev/showcase)

## Cross-platform Single Codebase Native App

Flutter is _mobile first_, has full/official support for Web/PWAs
using the _same_ code base as the Native Mobile and Desktop Apps.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/71738403-6bda0b00-2e4e-11ea-85d1-0d9aefb7c1e4.png)

Targetting all these platforms 
with a _single_ codebase 
is a _compelling_ proposition 
and it's only getting better! <br />
See: 
[medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-8c74a5bc32d0](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-8c74a5bc32d0)

Google is investing _heavily_ in Flutter,
it's used for the Google Assistant, Google Ads and Stadia!

## Guiding Principals 

Returning to the **`@dwyl`**
**guiding principals for technology selection**  
outlined in the `README.md`
We can see that `Flutter` meets all of them:

+ [x] 1. **Security**: advanced security features: https://flutter.dev/security
  + https://medium.com/@mehmetf_71205/securing-flutter-apps-ada13e806a69
+ [x] 2. **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers, high contrast and large fonts: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/accessibility
+ [x] 3. **Open Source**: Flutter was initially developed by Google but has since been spun out into an independent GitHub Org. Google still handles security reporting and that's a _good_ thing because you know someone at Google is _responsible_ for acting _fast_ when a security report is made.
+ [x] 4. **People Centric**: the fact that it can ship to _any_ device/platform makes it _very_ people-centric because the UX will _great_ no matter where the person is using it.
  + Gorgeous _Native_ User Interaction including built-in support for gestures, voice, transitions and animations. These might feel like "nice to have" but some people _really_ love these micro-interactions.
  + Native performance up to 120fps means buttery smooth UI anywhere (_where there is a display with a sufficiently [high refresh rate](https://youtu.be/-2pffpPl1lQ?t=197)_) because of the Dart compiler.
+ [x] 5. **Mobile First**: the _first_ platform Flutter targeted was (_Native_) Android. Flutter is still predominantly used for Mobile UI but it can be used to build Desktop, Google Assistant, Web Apps and "Ambient Computing"! See: https://flutter.dev/showcase and https://youtu.be/NfNdXgJZfFo?t=884
+ [x] 6. **Responsive**: The Flutter UI framework is designed to work on _any_ screen size without the Dev(s) having to jump through hoops to check the device width/height and debug random screen sizes!
see: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/responsive
+ [x] 7. **Offline First**: SQLite
https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/sqlite
+ [x] 8. **Developer _Effectiveness_**
+ [x] 9. Internationalisation: Flutter has been built for internationalisation from the start: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization
+ [x] 10. Custom UI: with Material Theming, Devs/Designers can have _full_ control over the UI see:
[youtube.com/watch?v=NfNdXgJZfFo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfNdXgJZfFo&list=PLjxrf2q8roU0o0wKRJTjyN0pSUA6TI8lg)

### What about `Elm`?


We still ‚ù§Ô∏è `Elm` and have used it _recently_.
We _love_ `elm-ui` and have recently published an
[`elm-ui` _tutorial_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elm/tree/master/tutorials/elm-ui).
We think compiler checks for layout are amazing!
However it's an undeniable fact has not been much _progress_
in the `Elm` ecosystem over the past year.
-->

# _How_?

As noted in the main `README.md`,
we are using 
`Elixir` + `Phoenix` + `PostgreSQL` 
for the Web App.
By using `LiveView`, `Tailwind` and `Alpine.js` 
(AKA the `PETAL` stack)
to build features as a Web App _first_
we iterate _fast_ 
and maintain full control over 
[**`SEO`**](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues/81#issuecomment-1146670657).

Once the feature is _built_ for the Web
fast-loading and SEO-friendly `HTML`,
we will port the feature to 
`Dart` +
`Flutter` 
for a cross-platform offline-first native exeperience.

## `Dart`

`Dart` is a strongly typed object oriented 
general purpose programming language.
It is the language used to build `Flutter` Apps.
https://dart.dev/
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/71881397-1e012380-312a-11ea-9dcf-476ca9ee31e6.png)

If you know any `JavaScript` (`ES6`)
and `TypeScript` then you will feel at home in `Dart`

More detail in: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-dart

<!--
Last year we wrote a post titled
"_Would you still pick **`Elixir`** in **2019**?_"
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/102
several people in the community found it useful.
We need to update it and add a section on Benchmarks:
https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks
-->

## `Flutter`

We are recording our learning of `Flutter` in:
[dwyl/learn-flutter](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter)

All the _practical_ detail is there.


<br />

# Background

We are building our App: 
[dwyl/app](https://github.com/dwyl/app).
We selected **`Phoenix`** for the Backend 
because we find **`Elixir`** easy to read, reason about and write. 
(far more so than other major programming languages). 
More detail in: 
[learn-elixir/issues/102](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/102)
The data we are storing is _relational_ in nature. 
We are creating `items` of `text` 
that have an _unlimited_ length. 
We want to apply meta data to those `items` 
and create rich interactions around them. 
We will have _many_ useful features in the App
but the core will be `items`, `timers`, `lists` and `people`.

As a _small_ team with finite resources 
(_and no desire to "raise" money from outside investors_), 
we want to maximise our efforts 
to build the App that _most_ people want/need. 
We are focussing on building the Web App initially 
because the web is universally accessible. 
_Many_ companies have focussed their initial efforts on `iOS` 
because it's the _easiest_ platform to target, 
`iOS` users have more disposable income 
and are more likely to _pay_ for apps.

> "_Making an App for `iOS` is Faster and Less Expensive_".
> "_`Android` users tend to be 
> less willing to pay for apps than `iOS` users, 
> so free apps with in-app ads are more common._"
https://medium.com/@the_manifest/android-vs-ios-which-platform-to-build-your-app-for-first-22ea8996abe1
> There are fewer iOS devices to target and test on which dramatically shortens dev timelines.
e.g in 2022 there are only **7 supported screen sizes** for iPhone:
> + 4" - iPhone 5S and SE (old screen size but still used by [tens of millions](https://deviceatlas.com/blog/most-popular-iphones) people)
> + 4.7" - iPhone 6, 7, 8 and SE 2020 & 2022
> + 5.42" - iPhone 12 & 13 Mini
> + 5.5" iPhone 6 Plus, 7 Plus and 8 Plus
> + 5.85" - iPhone X, XS and 11 Pro
> + 6.06" - iPhone XR, iPhone 11, 12 & 13 Pro
> + 6.46" - iPhone XS Max and iPhone 11, 12, 13 Pro Max
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devices
The _full_ device feature compatibility matrix 
is lets developers see _exactly_ what features are available for all iOS devices (including all iPads): https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/Displays/Displays.html

> In **2015** there were _already_ 
> "_more than **24,000 different `Android` devices**
> from 1300 brands_"
https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-fragmentation-there-are-now-24000-devices-from-1300-brands
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/83424494-60523680-a424-11ea-829c-d75be55d7f17.png)
That was before the _explosion_ of new devices from Chinese and manufacturers.
In 2022 there is no official stat 
for the number of devices or screen sizes 
(_because Google is painfully aware 
of the fragmentation problem 
but doesn't want to surface it!_) 
suffice to say that it's _several_ orders of magnitude 
more complex to build an Android App 
that looks _consistently_ good across all devices.
Android development is _considerably_ more complex, 
which is why devs prefer `iOS` for their MVP.

# StackOverflow Dev Survey

Flutter was first included in the 2020 dev survey
and was the 3rd "most loved" framework:
[https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools-loved3)
